# Advanced Usage - Servers

This page documents advanced usage of Pelican servers. Features listed below are for server admins familiar with Pelican Servers.

## Pre-generate Server Credentials

### Server Private Key

Pelican servers relies on a ECDSA key-pair for signing and verifying tokens used in API requests and object accesses. Pelican servers automatically generate a private key in ECDSA form at the server start, and provide the public key through the OIDC-style discovery endpoint at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. The public key is useful for various things including Origin namespace prefix registration at the registry (see details [here](../federating-your-data.mdx#obtain-the-public-key-of-the-origin)).

In deployment, it can be convenient to generate the key-pair in advance and mount the private key file to the Pelican server via configuration variable, especially in a container environment. Pelican CLI comes with a command `pelican generate keygen` for generating server private/public key pair:

```bash copy
pelican generate keygen
```

and Pelican will generate both the private key and the public key under the current working directory:

```console
Successfully generated keys at:
Private key: /path/to/issuer.jwk
Public Key: /path/to/issuer-pub.jwks
```

You can change the location of the generated keys by passing in  arguments `private-key` and/or `public-key`:


```bash copy
pelican generate keygen --private-key /tmp/foo --public-key /tmp/bar
```

The generated *private key* can be passed to a Pelican server via `IssuerKey` configuration parameter so that the server will take advantage of the generated key instead of generating a new key.


```yaml filename="pelican.yaml" copy
IssuerKey: /path/to/generated/issuer.jwk
```


### Admin Website Password

The `pelican generate` command generates the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html) password file for storing the admin website login password. By pre-generating the htpasswd file, Pelican server admin can skip the initial website setup with the one-time passcode. To generate a password file, run:

```bash copy
pelican generate password
```

and Pelican will prompt you to enter and confirm the password:

```console
Enter your password:
Confirm the password:

Successfully generated the admin password file at: /path/to/server-web-passwd
```

You can change the location of the generated htpasswd file by the `-o` or `--output` argument. You can also provide the file that contains your password through the `-p` or `--password` argument.

```bash copy
pelican generate password -o /path/to/generated-htpasswd-file -p /path/to/password
```

The generated htpasswd file can then be passed to the Pelican server via `Server.UIPasswordFile` configuration parameter.

```yaml filename="pelican.yaml" copy
Server:
  UIPasswordFile: /path/to/generated-htpasswd-file
```
