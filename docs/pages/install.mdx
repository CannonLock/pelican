# Install Pelican

This document lists the operating system requirements for Pelican and explains how a user can download and install Pelican.

## Before Starting

Pelican executables can run as a **client** or a **server**.

For client usage, such as accessing the data, you can download and install a Pelican package or Pelican binary [following the instructions below](#install-pelican-binary).

For server usage, such as serving your data to a Pelican data federation or start a new Pelican data federation, you need to run Pelican using [Pelican Docker images](./install/docker.mdx). It is not recommended to run Pelican server with a binary. Although possible, additional software dependencies and configurations are required to allow the server to be functional.


## Supported Operating Systems

Pelican supports the following operating systems, when running as a **client**:

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Alma, Rocky, or openSUSE)](./install/rhel.mdx)
* [Debian or Ubuntu](./install/debian.mdx)
* [Alpine Linux](./install/alpine.mdx)
* [macOS](./install/macos.mdx)
* Windows

> **Note**: Installation of Pelican on other operating systems is possible, but not recommended or supported.

## Download Pelican Binary

Download the binary based on your operating system and CPU architecture. For instructions on how to install the binary, refer to [the next section](#install-pelican-binary).

### What version should I download?
Our versions are built like so:
For example: 7.1.2
- 7 represents the major version release
- 1 represents feature releases
- 2 represents a bug fix/patch release

The download section above always shows the latest released version of Pelican and we recommend you to use the latest feature or major release version so it includes the latest bug fixes and features. If you would like to download a previous version, please refer to our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases).

## Install Pelican Binary

### Linux

* [Install Pelican on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Alma, Rocky, or openSUSE)](./install/rhel.mdx)
* [Install Pelican on Debian or Ubuntu](./install/debian.mdx)
* [Install Pelican on Alpine Linux](./install/alpine.mdx)

### macOS

* [Install Pelican on macOS](./install/macos.mdx)

## Verify Pelican Is Installed

> If you installed Pelican as a standalone binary, you need to add Pelican to your `PATH` environment variable before proceeding.

1. Run the following command after you installed Pelican RPM

    ```bash
    which pelican
    ```

    It should output

    ```console
    /bin/pelican
    ```

2. Test Pelican client function by running an **object copy** command that download a test file from [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf) to your current directory

    ```bash
    $ pelican -f osg-htc.org object copy /ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt .
    test.txt 14.00b / 14.00b [=============================================================================================] Done!
    ```

## Next Steps

* [Access data with Pelican client](../client-usage.mdx)
* [Serve your data with Pelican Origin server](../serving_an_origin.mdx)
* [Serve a new Pelican Pelican federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx)
