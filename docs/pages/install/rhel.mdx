# Install Pelican on CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Alma, or Rocky

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Red Hat-based Linux distribution system such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE.

## Install Pelican RPM

You can install Pelican from the standalone RPM, or with the binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

### Install the Pelican RPM package manually

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican-x.x.x-aarch64.rpm` if you select **ARM64** (ARM), where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    ```

    Example to install Pelican `v7.5.8` RPM for X86_64 machine:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican-7.5.8-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```

### Install Pelican as a standalone binary

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **X86_64** or **AMR64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` if you select **ARM64**.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz // ARM user
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` if you are running an Intel/AMD machine.

    Example to install Pelican binary for an ARM machine:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
    ```

5. The above command extracted the binary from the tar file. You may run the binary in the current folder, but it is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow `pelican` to be called directly from your command line.

    * Run Pelican binary from the downloaded folder:

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Linux_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ ./pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

    ```

    * Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` for the current terminal

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Linux_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH # Add current folder to the PATH
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

    ```

    * Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` permanently

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican_Linux_arm64 # Go to the binary folder
    $ echo 'export PATH=$PWD:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc # Add the current folder to your .bashrc file
    $ source ~/.bashrc # Apply the change
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

    Version: 7.5.8

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop grafana
  ```
